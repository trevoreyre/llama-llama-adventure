[Cotton Bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/)

Cotton Bureau is probably the top contender. Iâ€™ve come across a bunch of people who sell merch through them, and everyone says the quality is top notch. Forthwall might also be a good contender.

If we wanted to list stuff weâ€™re selling on Cotton Bureau on our own website, I assume weâ€™d have to do that manually? I donâ€™t see an API or anything like that.

One possibility would be to set up different products with different services, but show them all on our own website. It would be a kinda clunky buying experience, though, because every product would redirect to a separate service to check out. Might be fine, though.

[Threadless](https://www.threadless.com/)

Threadless has a wider variety of products you can make. I donâ€™t know if the quality is as high as Cotton Bureau.

[Fourthwall](https://fourthwall.com/)

Fourthwall looks to be more for doing a full website. We donâ€™t actually want that. Just merch. But we could do just merch and not use the rest of the website building features. And we would have more control over what the shop landing page looks like. And they have mugs. And it still seems super high quality. MKBHD uses them.

[Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com/portfolio/manage_works)

Redbubble has a TON of products. Weâ€™d have to try a couple out to see what the quality and experience is like.
