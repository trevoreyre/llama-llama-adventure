Write a sponsored (ad) Instagram post including emojis about the partnership between Dragonfly Energy and Keystone RV Company notifying viewers that most 2023 Keystone RV’s are going to come stock with lithium ion batteries. Include a list of benefits for lithium vs old fashioned lead acid batteries, including the following bullet points: More power- offers 2X the power in the same physical space. 5X faster charging. Reliable power when you need it— eliminates the “dead” battery battle- the last battery you’re likely to ever own.  Lighter weight- up to 80% less for the same amount of usable power. As you can see by our dino 🦖 lifting weights and using heavy workout equipment in this video. Until now did not have the weight capacity to tow these extras without making other sacrifices. A typical 100Ah lead acid battery weighs 60-80 lbs each. The Dragonfly Energy batteries weigh only 31 lbs each. End post with a question that will prompt viewers to engage and tell us what they would bring with the additional 60-100 lbs cargo capacity? Does this matter to them? Thank both companies for gifting us two lithium ion batteries for our 2019 Keystone Sprinter Campfire and explain how this will allow us to #campbetter. Include hashtags: #keystonerv #krvbrandambassador #campbetter #dragonflyenergy #lithiumionbatteries #lifepo4 #golithium.



🏕️🚐🔋 Exciting news for all outdoor enthusiasts! Thanks to the partnership between @dragonflyenergy and @keystonervcompany, most 2023 Keystone RV's will come stock with lithium-ion batteries! 🙌

We're thrilled to announce that we've been gifted two of these incredible batteries for our 2019 Keystone Sprinter Campfire. Compared to old fashioned lead-acid batteries, here are just a few benefits we've noticed:

🔋 More power - offers 2X the power in the same physical space
⚡ 5X faster charging
💪 Reliable power when you need it - eliminates the "dead" battery battle
📦 Lighter weight - up to 80% less for the same amount of usable power

Our dino 🦖 was able to lift weights and use heavy workout equipment without any problem, thanks to the lighter weight of these batteries. Previously, we didn't have the weight capacity to tow these extras without making sacrifices. A typical 100Ah lead-acid battery weighs 60-80 lbs each, but the Dragonfly Energy batteries weigh only 31 lbs each!

Thank you @dragonflyenergy and @keystonervcompany for gifting us with these amazing lithium-ion batteries. They will allow us to #campbetter and experience the great outdoors like never before! ⛺️🌳

We want to hear from you! With an additional 60-100 lbs of cargo capacity, what gear would you bring on your next outdoor adventure? Does this matter to you? Let us know in the comments below! ⬇️

Don't miss out on this game-changing technology. #keystonerv #krvbrandambassador #campbetter #dragonflyenergy #lithiumionbatteries #lifepo4 #golithium
