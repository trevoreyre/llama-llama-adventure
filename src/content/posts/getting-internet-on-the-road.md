Modem - Pepwave MAX Transit Pro E Dual CAT-12 LTEA Router. This router has two CAT-12 LTE routers, which support a wide range of cellular bands.

The only disadvantage of this compared to the Pepwave MAX CAT-7/CAT-12 modem is this one doesn’t support band 71 for T-Mobile’s rural internet coverage. But the support for AT&T and Verizon is better, which are the two we use.

## Do we need an antenna? 🤷🏼‍♀️ 

[Parsec Husky Pro 7](https://mobilemusthave.com/collections/antennas-accessories/products/parsec-husky-pro-7-7-in-1-5g-antenna?variant=39469792690275)

An antenna will probably make our connection a little more solid and reliable. If we get one, it will probably be the Parsec Husky Pro 7. But we will have to drill a hole in the ceiling and all that, which will be a pain.

If we got the Ultimate Road Warrior LE bundle with the Parsec antenna, it would cost **$1,653.74**. If we bought the two separate, it would cost **$1,725.79**. So the bundle saves about **$72**.

## What about a cell booster?

It seems like the short answer is “we *probably* don’t need a cell booster”. They can be useful if you’re just out of range of a tower, or to improve your upload speeds. But in most other cases where you have moderate or good signal strength, they can actually decrease your performance.
