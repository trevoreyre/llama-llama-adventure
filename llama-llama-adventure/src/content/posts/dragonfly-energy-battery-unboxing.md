# Unboxing Dragonfly Energy Lithium-Ion Batteries

🎉 We are thrilled to announce 💥 Keystone RV Companies partnership with ⚡ Dragonfly Energy- the manufacturer of Battle Born Batteries. Most 2023 Keystone RV models will come with Dragonfly batteries installed, which are also available exclusively from Keystone approved dealers- nowhere else. 🔋

As a Keystone owner, you have access to a dedicated technical support team at Dragonfly. Every battery shipped with a new Keystone or purchased from a Keystone dealer has a sticker on it with a toll-free number that connects you directly with a Dragonfly expert. 📞

What's more, all Dragonfly batteries purchased as original equipment or with a new Keystone RV or aftermarket get a groundbreaking 10-year warranty from the date of purchase. 🔐

Dragonfly Energy batteries are designed in the USA and have their headquarters in Reno, Nevada. They also come with an end-of-life return and recycling program- a greener option for many reasons. 🌿

As second year Keystone RV Ambassadors, we could not be happier to be joining the #golithium team with Dragonfly Energy! 🚐👍
