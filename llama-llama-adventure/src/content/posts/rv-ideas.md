- Some sort of lock for cabinet doors while traveling, like the shower doors have
- Better cabinet latches
- Easier way to install LTE antennas on the roof, like a place to mount it, a junction box, or some way to drop cables down without having to drill a big hole through the roof
- Dual thermostats, so both ACs can run on thermostat
- Access pass through storage from inside
- Dead space should be AGAINST YOUR RELIGION!
- Drop the carpet. All of it. If you are going to have carpet anywhere, you should at least avoid it under the dining table, or anywhere in the kitchen.
