We are @llamallaadventure: a mom, dad, 5 year old daughter and 2 dogs on a nomadic journey of rv dwelling. We’ve been living this lifestyle for going on 4 years come June and we have no intentions of giving it up in the foreseeable future. We’ve lived 1 year stationary. In the past 3 years we’ve traveled with our home on wheels to 31 states staying mostly in rv parks. We are 2nd year Keystone Rv Company Brand Ambassadors. We are looking forward to more off grid camping to come as we return for our second round through the western United States. Thanks to this battery upgrade that was gifted to us and partnership between Keystone and Dragonfly Energy we will be able to power more and stay out longer! (Explain the difference between rv park camping and off-grid camping aka boondocking). Our current off-grid setup consists of 2 170 amp solar panels- 340 watts total. We have plans to add more solar panels and an inverter to power our outlets once we install the 2 new 100Ah lithium ion batteries. We may be nearing our 4 year nomadiversary, but we could not be more excited for what’s to come in our future rv adventures, especially with the increased opportunity to get out further and for longer! Where should we go next? Where would you go with more power and less weight? Are you team RV park or team Wilderness? “Stay Wild @llamallamaadventure fans! We love you! ✌🏼 💕 “.

We are @llamallaadventure: a mom, dad, 5 year old daughter and 2 dogs on a nomadic journey of rv dwelling. We’ve been living this lifestyle for going on 4 years come June and we have no intentions of giving it up in the foreseeable future. We’ve lived our first year stationary in Idaho adjusting to rv life (we had never set foot in an rv before we bought one and loved into it 30 days later) and in the past 3 years we’ve traveled with our home on wheels to 31 states, staying mostly in rv parks. We are 2nd year Keystone Rv Company Brand Ambassadors. We are looking forward to more off grid camping to come as we return for our second round through the western United States.

We may be nearing our 4 year nomadiversary, but we could not be more excited for what’s to come in our future rv adventures, especially with the increased opportunity to get out further and for longer! Now that you know more about us, we want to know: Where should we go next? Where would you go with more power and less weight holding you back? Are you team RV park or team Wilderness? Tell us in the comments! And while you’re here, enjoy this look back of 1 second every day video clips from our last 4 years as adventure nomads. “Stay Wild @llamallamaadventure fans!

As we reflect on our nomadic journey, we realize that the RV life has given us the freedom to explore the beauty of America. With our trusty home on wheels, we have roamed from coast to coast, soaking in the diverse landscapes and cultures that this country has to offer. One of the greatest things about this lifestyle is the ability to choose between RV park camping or off-grid camping, also known as boondocking. RV parks offer amenities like full hookups, laundry facilities, and entertainment options, while boondocking provides a sense of seclusion and a chance to connect with nature on a deeper level.

Thanks to our recent battery upgrade, we are now able to power more and stay out longer. Our setup includes 2 170 amp solar panels, which generate 340 watts of power. We have plans to add even more solar panels and an inverter to power our outlets once we install our new 100Ah lithium ion batteries. With more power and less weight, we can explore further off the beaten path and truly embrace the spirit of adventure.

As we plan our next journey, we wonder where we should go next. Do you have any suggestions? Where would you go with more power and less weight? Are you team RV park or team Wilderness? Either way, we hope you stay wild, @llamallaadventure fans! We love you! ✌🏼 💕 🚐 🌲 ⛰️ 🌅



🏕️✨ It's been almost 4 years since we started our nomadic journey as @llamallaadventure! Can you believe it? We've been living on the road with our 5-year-old daughter and two furry companions ever since, and we couldn't be happier with our decision to live a life of adventure and freedom. 🚐💨

Our first year was spent stationary in Idaho, where we had to adjust to rv life. It was a challenge at first, but we quickly fell in love with the simplicity and flexibility of living on wheels. For the past 3 years, we've traveled to 31 states, staying mostly in rv parks. We've met amazing people, seen breathtaking landscapes, and created unforgettable memories that will last a lifetime. And we're just getting started!

As 2nd year Keystone Rv Company Brand Ambassadors, we're proud to be part of a community that shares our passion for rv life. And thanks to the battery upgrade that was gifted to us by Keystone and Dragonfly Energy, we can now power more and stay out longer on our off-grid adventures. 🔋🌞

Speaking of off-grid adventures, let's talk about the difference between rv park camping and boondocking. RV parks offer amenities such as electricity, water, and sewer hookups, as well as social activities and community events. Boondocking, on the other hand, is camping in remote locations without any hookups or facilities. It's a great way to experience nature and disconnect from the world, but it requires more preparation and self-sufficiency.

Our current off-grid setup includes 2 170 amp solar panels that provide a total of 340 watts of power. But we're not stopping there! We have plans to add more solar panels and an inverter to power our outlets once we install the 2 new 100Ah lithium ion batteries. 💪🌞

As we approach our 4 year nomadiversary, we're more excited than ever for what's to come. We're planning to explore the western United States once again, this time with more off-grid camping and fewer restrictions. But we need your help! Where should we go next? What are your favorite off-grid camping spots? Are you team RV park or team Wilderness? Let us know in the comments! 🗺️🌲

And while you're here, we want to share with you a glimpse of our journey so far. Check out this 1 second every day video from the last 4 years, and join us in celebrating the beauty and joy of rv life. 🎥❤️

Stay Wild, @llamallaadventure fans! We love you! ✌🏼💕



🚐🌲 Hey there, adventurers! We're @llamallaadventure: a family of four (plus our two furry friends) on a four-year journey of RV dwelling. That's right, we're coming up on our nomadiversary in June! 🎉

For the past three years, we've been traveling to 31 states, mostly staying in RV parks 🏞️, but we're also excited to do more off-grid camping as we head back to the western United States. And thanks to a battery upgrade gifted to us by Keystone and Dragonfly Energy, we'll be able to power more and stay out longer! 🔋

Right now, we have two 170 amp solar panels that give us a total of 340 watts, but we're planning on adding even more solar panels and an inverter to power our outlets once we install the two new 100Ah lithium ion batteries. 💡

We're so grateful for our partnership with Keystone and Dragonfly Energy, and we can't wait to see what adventures the future holds. Where do you think we should go next? 🤔 If you had more power and less weight, where would you go? Are you team RV park or team wilderness? Let us know in the comments below! 🌲✌️💕 #llamallaadventure #rvlife #offgrid #keystonervambassadors #nomadiversary #solarpower #staywild
