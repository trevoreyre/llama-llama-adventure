Maintaining friendships / relationships while
being on the road.

We visit once per year alternating the adult

Cabin week for each grandparent every year, usually around a holiday
How to stay sane with your partner in such a
confined space (3)

‚ÄúNight off‚Äù
Dealing with missing family/friends

Ask them to visit you! Trevor often reminds me it‚Äôs not only us that should make the effort to visit. We have space and cabins are available. We also go to some awesome spots. There is a map of where we are going on our website and we send it to any friends or family that ask.

-Free RV Family Summit- @livecampwork book\blog Sharee Collier (listen to podcast from Joshua Sheehan @Rv Entrepreneur podcast)

Mostly downsizing- take a picture of things you loved but aren‚Äôt keeping- costs in different areas of the USA for storage units and inflation- 300% in Texas - buy nothing Facebook groups 

Different styles of rv‚Äôers traveling at different paces- one person is traveling with a horse staying 3-5 months at a time

6-19-22

Back online! Social media fast was a welcomed calm and will be happening about every 90 days moving forward. Mondays will remain ‚Äúoffline‚Äù and I will create content including posts for the week and blog content on Wednesday evenings. Otherwise, expect posts as I feel inspired. Sunday lives will remain and grocery hauls will be announced as they come up. Still planning to do a cooking with us live at some point. Lives are my happy medium. Otherwise I was feeling overwhelmed with the daily grind and not feeling as present as a parent and partner. Need to focus on priorities: exploring/adventure lifestyle, cooking healthy meals, exercise and yoga, reading books (2 in last week) and keeping a clean and minimal space. Daily online hustle and bustle had me losing sight of those priorities.



Now‚Ä¶ back to the regularly scheduled content üòÇ¬†



3 year rv anniversary/dwelling! 2 years traveling! End of structural warranty.



10 year since meeting anniversary- 8 married. June 7-22nd.



Happy Father‚Äôs Day. Do you do gifts?



While we were away‚Ä¶ Washington DC!!!

Dogs were in boarding in Fredricksburg.

Tried to get tickets to Washington Monument tour 3 times. Nope.

Eco housing convention/tiny homes on National Mall.

Botanical Garden- Lennon planted tomatoes. We bought cold brew coffee beans from Zeke‚Äôs.

Gun protest.

Pride parade in our neighborhood- DuPont Circle.

Riding underground Metro.

Loved all of the Vegan food. Lots of falafel. Israeli food. German food at Berliner. But gross beer.

Loved our apartment and Uber Eats & DoorDash.

Loved Georgetown. Bought new clothes for Lia there. New clothes for Trevor on the way to DC for work trip.

Thought about doing canal tour.

Didn‚Äôt bring go girl! Lennon popped a squat like a champ.

Grocery shopped on way home since dogs.



Trevor in Santa Monica on work trip

Met in person from first time 

Berbere tacos

Santa Monica Brew Werx

Spent total of 20 minutes on the beach. Quick trip!

Ellison Institute

No issue flights. 20 minutes early coming back.



Lennon and Lia home with dogs

Met Arien & Matt from njoying.our.journey. Looking forward to seeing them again in South Carolina.

Wrote stories by Lennon and drew pictures. Signing her up for drawing class on Outschool.



Once T got home we just relaxed, did laundry and played legos all day and watched Tiny Shiny Home. Lia napped because she was exhausted.



Merch is a GO! Shirts and mugs! More to come.



Moved from VA to PA!

Looking forward to Hershey Park. Considering 2 day pass or 2 annual passes? Having a hard time choosing since Lennon is right at 41.5 inches and 42 inches is when she can do all of the fun water and amusement rides. She may be disappointed if we go with families with older kids that can do more than her based on these restrictions.

Excited to see Randie and Hal.



Upcoming: vision appointments for all and dentist for Trevor! Lia- float tank aka deprivation tank. Must wet dreadlocks first and wash well after. Also infrared sauna! Going to be working on more maintenance and purging!!! Should we ditch grill and fire pit? Also separating seasonal clothes for Lia after all. Rv wash & roof treatment. Truck detail? Always ask permission at rv park!

Thanks for understanding us adjusting the posting schedule. Really appreciate those that reached out while offline to check in on us. Still open to content requests. Just going to be enjoying more time offline. That‚Äôs why we set out on this adventure to begin with!

8-7-22

We made it to Indiana! Staying at Shipshewana. Ready for the Keystone rv rally Wednesday-Sunday! Trevor is off Wednesday, Thursday Friday. Going to RV Hall of Fame! What else should we do? 

We are going to Keystone to ask about the swoops at the Rally- what questions do you want us to ask?

We had a great stay with Harvest Hosts at American Winery/Brewery- 21 gun salute! Going back in 2 weeks after Indiana and Michigan and testing the beer flight. Don‚Äôt know if it has a fancy name. It‚Äôs 10 beers. Going to take drone footage when we go back! Loved seeing 4 campers pull in at once and live music. Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the insane cockroach and 95¬∞ weather with 96% humidity. Had to run the generator until a little after midnight to get it cooled down. Saw someone share about a soft start up plug in that may allow us to run two airs on predator 3500 generator? May need to look at that. How do you feel about generator use in those circumstances? We weren‚Äôt the last to turn ours off but did notice it was quiet at some point. Everyone started the generators early though.

Oops on gas and stabilizer mixture! Should be okay. Also, it‚Äôs really expensive to run a generator for so many hours!

Truck battery died and we had to get a jump this morning. Of course we only tried to hitch at 11:30 with the intentions of leaving at noon. We left a few minutes after 1pm. We had Safeco on the way to jump us but since the winery opens at 1pm the owner arrived around 12:30 and jumped us. Did you know there are two batteries??? We almost didn‚Äôt get the jump because we tried the wrong one! The things you learn after 3 years and almost 70,000 miles on our truck. We bought used with only 30k miles and a single owner! Hitch included. Towed back and forth from Idaho to Arizona. Like the time we learned you could flip up the mirrors to see better when you‚Äôre towing after we had owned the truck for a year and a half.

We also need to replace the batteries on our tire pressure monitors.

Just met two people who will be at rally. We already know one couple. Looking forward to meeting more! Hoping that there will be a few kids as Lennon‚Äôs coming with us. Dogs will be in boarding Wednesday-Saturday night.

We want to go to more rallies but the ones with Escapees and Fulltime Families club haven‚Äôt lined up with our travels and booking 6 months out.

Nachos for dinner! We know there won‚Äôt be a lot of vegan food in the area and the rally coordinator from Keystone already informed us it‚Äôs a dry county! We brought beer! Grateful keystone will be making vegan alternatives for us to enjoy at the shared meals.

Going to be doing factory/plant tours: Avalanche, Bullet, Cougar, Fuzion, Sprinter, Montana, Raptor. Talking routine maintenance with experts, talk lithium batteries & solar. So excited for the nature cleanup! Ending with a bang with a Queen cover band!

Ohio was quick! Only really saw Geneva-On-The-Lake and Cleveland. Met Jay in Cleveland and definitely need to spend time with them when we go back and maybe paint on the live bus! 

After we go to Michigan for a week it‚Äôs back to Ohio then back to Pennsylvania. All quick less than one week stopovers with Harvest Hoste to break up drives. Throwing Maryland and Delaware into the mix to say we‚Äôve slept there! Need to put up map!

After all of the  quick trips we arrive to New Jersey for the first time and get back to the 3 week stay schedule. The busy time of year for us will pass quickly! Trevor and Lennon have an upcoming trip to Boise. We are getting excited for our upcoming cruise in February! Fam chat is starting to get going.

It‚Äôs going to be a busy week! We will do our best to keep you up to date but who knows how much we will share. Most of the sharing will probably come later so we can be present and build relationships.

We are going to the water park too.

Last year we went to Legoland for Lennon‚Äôs birthday. Still waiting to hear fulltime families homeschool day rate for Legoland this year. Last year we went like 3 times.

We also did Disney last year for the week after thanksgiving with Trevor‚Äôs family.

We are at TTO now and lots of families around.

Peace River was lit! Campfires every single day for the entire 2 weeks. Made lots of new friends. A few of them are traveling together now but we couldn‚Äôt deviate from our plan of heading west for the summer.

We may have a site in Boise now for 3-4 months. It will be closer than Mountain Home and make it easier to downsize our storage and hang with family. Will confirm next week!

Lia went paddle boarding for the first time. And the second. Lennon went too for moms and daughters day.

Trevor was supposed to go on a dads day paddle boarding but our friends reservation for messed up and we really need to get our own paddle board.

Excited for Universal! Need to go to bed!

Universal!

We spent 2 days at Universal Studios, 2 days at Islands of Adventure, and 1 day at Volcano Bay.

2 days at each park was actually a little too much time. We ran out of rides and things to do. But 1 day wouldn‚Äôt quite be enough. Best option might be to do 1.5 days at each park. You‚Äôll pay more for park to park but need fewer days overall.

Our favorite area was Harry Potter world, especially Diagon Alley which is located at Universal Orlando.

Our favorite rides were Hagrid‚Äôs Forbidden Forest, Velocicoaster, and the E.T. ride.

There were a LOT of 3D movie style rides, which wasn‚Äôt our favorite. Having a few rides of that style is fine, but there were just too many- especially at Universal Orlando.

We used child swap a lot for rides Lennon was either too short for or not interested in. You all wait in line together, then the adults take turn riding while the other stays with the child. It‚Äôs a good system! They play the movies in the family room from that ride. 

We didn‚Äôt get any express passes at all, and it turned out fine. We did every single ride and every show in the parks. Express passes were unnecessary. Maybe if you were only in the park 1 day they might be helpful. A few rides always had 1.5-2 hour waits, like Hagrid‚Äôs Forbidden Forest ride. We did end up with 3 each because on the New York ride they miscounted and Lennon & Lia had to go back out and wait for the next ride. We wanted to do Mummy but it didn‚Äôt work for that and we had already done everything else we wanted. We used it on‚Ä¶

Inconsistent height requirements were a real problem for us a couple times. Lennon is right at 42 inches, which is the cutoff for a lot of rides. We had several times where they measured her at the start of the line and said she was tall enough, then measured her again after we had waited in line and said she was too short. So be prepared for that. If your kid is near one of the height limits, wear really tall shoes, if possible.

## 3-5-23

Cruise!

Grandma Mary‚Äôs 90th birthday!

Also my 35th birthday!

Also my dad‚Äôs, brother-in-law‚Äôs, and cousin‚Äôs birthday!

My whole family went on the cruise (minus kids), so there were about 20 of us.

Our first port was Cozumel

Excursion

Second port was Grand Cayman

Tendering in

Excursion

Food

Balcony room

Moved to TTO



3-12-23

We just moved from TTO to Bulow in Flagler Beach

Parents went home to Oregon on Friday. They barely made it to Florida because they had the largest snow storm on record since 1943 but made it home with nothing but a 45 minute delay.

Lake Apopka Wildlife Drive

Crayola Experience

Silver Springs Kayaking

Beer Spa

Indian food

Movie date

Trevor‚Äôs back to working out with a trainer and I need to get back into routine. Was going to cancel Beachbody but just paid 1 year in January so I guess I get that and Brysen‚Äôs group fitness!

Picked up a package from FedEx for an upcoming campaign we are excited for. More details to come the middle of next week! Stay tuned.

General life on the road! Hannah asked if we missing anything about being in a house and having lots of stuff vs living minimally and having more experiences? She also asked about health care and doctors visits. She thought maybe that would be controversial but no big deal at all! Discuss Aspen dental and pediatric dentists as well as health insurance and apps and prescription fills for narcolepsy meds. Annual virtual visit with sleep doc.



3-26-23

Bye Florida! We were in Florida this year from 1/1-3/26. Perfect amount of time. Should we play the thousand trails shuffle next year or book a seasonal site? We will likely go to Texas after the balloon fiesta ending mid-October and then arrive to Florida around 1/1 again?

Hello Alabama! First time to Gulf Shores. Excited to go to the state park and beach! Nice campground but again ants. üêú¬†We will let you know next Sunday what we get into. Haven‚Äôt made plans yet.

Should we keep Sunday lives at 8pm eastern or change them to the time zone we are in as we travel west? Mountain Time is as far as we are going.

The official trek to Idaho has begun! 70 nights. 3,220 miles. 15 stops. 11 states. Approximately $5,550 between fuel at an average of $4.75/gallon and rv sites. Hopefully it will be less if fuel drops. We fueled once this week for under $4/gallon. Using a lot of discount apps and cards like Upside, TSD, and Mudflap. It‚Äôs $7,450 if you include our Idaho rent for 3 months. Our most expensive year since living stationary 1 year in idaho. $5,000 is a lot for us in 6 months- more than we spent last year total in fuel and sites, including thousand trails dues‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why we were on the east coast for 2 years. üòÇ¬†Fuel and sites can be expensive and I want to be fully transparent that Thousand trails is what typically makes this possible for us to achieve financially. It cost us approximately $4,200 the first time we crossed from east to west but fuel has gone up in price since then.

We paid over $20k/year in rent in Boise. It would be $27k/year now with inflation for same townhouse.

We arrive in Idaho June 3rd and just reserved a campground 20 minutes from Trevor‚Äôs parents house until September 2nd. Had to pay cancellation of 20% for 1 month (approximately $100) to cancel the site we had originally booked in Mountain Home. We had friends that were going to host us in Cascade for no cost but we decided this was closer to family and our storage unit. We also need to get our rig into the shop for some maintenance and repairs since it will have been to 31 states since leaving Idaho 3 years ago. Slide bottoms need repair and we are finally going to install our solar inverter so we can boondock longer.

Moochdocking with our friends Shannon and Roy for their son Royce‚Äôs birthday. 180 degree turn around in their heavily forested driveway in Quincy, Florida. Mountain bike and dirt bmx trails. 27 acres of land. Pigs, horses, chickens, ducks. Beautiful garden. Kids played on a nearly 20 foot inflatable water slide. It was a blast! Our friend Roy cut down 1 tree to help us get turned around and it was so nice to see them. We met them at a Harvest Host last summer in Clemson, SC. They‚Äôre part time travelers in a Keystone Hideout.

A few other things from last week:

Met (usandtheroad) Magda, Luna, Flori and Magda‚Äôs brother Matt who was visiting from Connecticut. We almost met last year in SC but laundry blocked us from making the connection. Specifically a child‚Äôs car seat needing to be washed ü§¢¬†. We had the best time at New Smyrna Dunes Park. Inlet is good for kids and walked to the ocean side admiring shells and looking for crabs. Lennon and Luna hit it off. Can‚Äôt wait to see them again but they head for Tennessee soon and will be having a new baby in July. Looking forward to seeing them again next winter with baby.

Lennon and Lia went to two National Monuments: Castillo de San Marcos and Fort Matanzas both in St Augustine. Also loved walking through historical downtown St Augustine

Paid our taxes! Did you pay yours yet?

Two campaign posts coming out this week. Stay tuned! We will be busy between shooting reels and exploring a new to us city and a few other things like installing the mirror on our truck.



4-9-23 Kalyn, Marketing Coordinator from Dragonfly as guest.

Can you tell us more about your company? Product? Position? Partnership with Keystone RV Company for 2023 stock batteries on all 2023 models (except for destination trailers)? What exactly does this setup include?

 When compared to standard deep-cycle lead acid batteries, Dragonfly Lithium batteries:
o More power - offers two times the power in the same physical space
o Lighter weight - weigh up to 80% less for the same amount of usable power
o Faster Charging - charge 5X faster
o Reliable power when you need it -- eliminates the ‚Äúdead‚Äù battery battle ‚Äì the last
battery you‚Äôre likely to ever own.

A typical 100Ah lead acid battery weighs 60-80 lbs. Your new 100Ah DFE battery weighs 31 lbs. What gear could you carry with the extra 60-100lbs cargo capacity?

 All Dragonfly batteries purchased as original equipment with a new Keystone RV or aftermarket get a groundbreaking 10-year warranty from the date of purchase.

Follower Questions for Dragonfly:

Hannah: Are you supposed to take the batteries out for winterization? Talk about heating element.

Hannah: What‚Äôs the life expectancy of this battery?

Lia: Can you tell us about the end of life recycling program? This was a selling point for us.

Lia: What future innovations might we see from Dragonfly Energy?

Dave & Danny: Libertyontherv: Can you clarify  that lithium batteries can‚Äôt fully charge without solar or hitting the magic button in your progressive dynamic‚Äôs distribution panel. A lot of people are getting confused not realizing that no keystone rvs pre-SolarFlex have a lithium mode to their dc charger. They will only charge to 80% otherwise.

We are choosing to do a professional install for our batteries as we already have some slide work scheduled when we arrive to Idaho in June and I spoke with the tech about the batteries and he said we need to swap our converter to one that is lithium capable. Is this what Dave is talking about? Or can you put this into a non-tech guru explanation? We are fairly green to the technicalities of solar and lithium and learning as much as we can.

Also, anyone interested in more technical posts on this I highly suggest following Dave & Danny who are a father son duo in a Keystone Fuzion. Dave is a disabled veteran traveling with his teenage son. Currently creating YouTube coverage of their massive solar install with FSI (Future Solutions) & Keystone in Indiana. Started with 400 SolarFlex stock and adding 2,640 watts for a total 3,040 watts. They added 3 additional 270Ah Gamechanger 3.0‚Äôs. I believe that‚Äôs over 1,000Ah‚Äôs total. What a massive setup! Pretty awesome!

We don‚Äôt have a weight capacity in our rig to ever accommodate 3,000 watts of solar or 1,000Ah‚Äôs of batteries (no matter how light weight they are). Can you explain what 200Ah‚Äôs could run in comparison to 1,000? We‚Äôre pretty boring with our power consumption aside from air conditioning. We even hand grind our coffee beans and then do pour over coffee from boiled water on our propane stove.

A few extra things to note:

Dedicated technical support team at Dragonfly. Every battery shipped
with a Keystone or purchased from a Keystone dealer has a sticker on it with a toll-free number that connects you directly with a Dragonfly factory expert.

Can you tell us how someone would purchase these aftermarket for a older model or if they are not a Keystone owner?

Lennon: why is it called Dragonfly?

Closing- where can viewers learn more and follow along for more info from Dragonfly Energy?



After Dragonfly- weekly updates:

Trevor caught the cold Lennon had a week ago while we were in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Just left New Orleans, Louisiana. Now in Arkansas.

We stayed at Sun Outdoors New Orleans North Shore. Beautiful lake but they didn‚Äôt have the paddle boards or kayaks out for the summer season yet which is the reason why we booked it. Also disappointed that the dogs weren‚Äôt allowed anywhere. The lazy river was amazing though! Didn‚Äôt get to do much since we were only there 6 days. Spent most of the time exploring.

New Orleans is now Lennon‚Äôs favorite city. We really wanted to go to the first cemetery but ran out of time. Would have gone Friday but back to back moves means we needed to clean. It also had an aerial flood warning so not a good time to go see dead bodies in tombs above ground.

Went to two libraries. One near where we were staying and one in New Orleans at City Park.

Trevor got to go to City Park and have donuts. Also too many dog rules.

Hop on hop off bus was awesome. Marci Gras World. Dat Dog on Magazine Street. French Market bucket hat.

This week will be all about homestead life.



4-23-23

Moochdocking in Arkansas.

1 week at Brooke and Jordan‚Äôs (@hayeshumblehomestead). They have pigs, cows, chickens, bunnies, guineas, and goats. Lennon got to help feed the animals every morning.

Went to an alpaca farm with some local homeschool kids.

They are building a fort for the kids in honor of their late son Hayes.

We loved all of the garden salads!

1 week at Liz and Davis‚Äôs (@emkirsch)

Liz also has a business, Wholesome Heart Homestead, where she makes hand-made aprons, beeswax wraps, and more! wholesomeheart.biz.

Lennon learned to sew with Liz and made a dress!

There was a tornado that went through Shawnee, Oklahoma last week, so we saw a bunch of uprooted trees and destroyed signs. So that‚Äôs fun!

This week we‚Äôre getting new brakes on the truck, and fixing the windshield wiper fluid reservoir.

We‚Äôre gonna go watch our friend‚Äôs Wildthornbaileys documentary on Scripps at 8‚Äì9 PM



4-29-23

Who loved the song of the smooth jazz on the announcement post for tonight‚Äôs live?

Mountain time

No tornados!

Used our Boonshoft Museum recporical benefits at the Oklahoma City Science Museum twice

They had an epic vegan salad

Wanted to go to OKC zoo but didn‚Äôt have time

Ordered our victron components to upgrade our solar system and invert the entire coach. Parts have been ordered but still waiting on date for install. We are also getting rollers added to our slides. Bish‚Äôs RV Center in Meridian, Idaho estimates 3-4 days for the updates.

$2,200 on new brakes and all of the things that go along with that. Bought our truck at 35k miles 4 years ago and it‚Äôs at 110k miles now. Worth the $2,200 to have visiting 31 states in the last 3 years.

Windshield wiper reservoir also replaced

Power cord and EMS failure- replaced both. Power cord failed continuity test and we had recently taped it together with electrical tape. Things wear out after 4 years of constant use!

Luckily Progressive Industries has a lifetime warranty on the EMS (over $300).

We were 7 minutes from Camping World so it made that easy.

Holey Rollers donuts- bonus book store

Flower Child bowls

Cava & Whole Foods- really need groceries and dog food!

Dogs both had teeth cleaned. Mango (7) has all 4 large teeth broken but closed fractures and BP has 2 large teeth broken but closed fractures. Threw away their hard bones and switching to Nylabone Silver Collection flexi bones.

First time to Texas and it was less than 24 hours. Did a pick up at first rest stop on I-40. We challenge you to pick up for 5 minutes at every rest stop on your road trips or move days!

Amarillo KOA

Six Car brewery- great pale ale!

Missed Cadillac ranch

Saw the saddest cows

Arrived to the land of enchantment! It‚Äôs so much prettier than Texas! Happy to see hills and color!

Bandalier National Monument near Santa Fe

Petroglyph National Monument- Jenn said rangers told her to be cautious of car break ins

Friend told us to go to Taos but it‚Äôs too far away for this short week long visit

Coming back in October for 2 weeks for the balloon fiesta

Durango is up next!

Recorded podcast with Kate from @midwesternersgonerogue for RV Queens- stay tuned for that to come out. Listen to others for now. Patty Gill from @gillsonwheels was recently on and it was amazing.

5-7-23

Confirmed our drop off date for the rv slide repairs and our solar upgrades in Idaho for the first week of June. We will take a vacation to Portland, Oregon as a family while the rv is in for repairs. It will be weird being houseless for the first time in 4 years. We‚Äôve not taken the rig in without getting it back the same day since we first bought it in June 2020 and the air conditioner failed the first week.

Trevor is going to be booking a trip to California again in July. It will be easier flying from Idaho than the east coast. Maybe Lia can even go with him if we get a dog and kid sitter!

Lia booked a trip to Indiana in July/August for the Keystone rally! Lennon will spend a week at grandma and grandpas in Portland, Oregon and Trevor and the dogs will hold down the fort in Boise with the trailer. Flying into Grand Rapids, Michigan early to spend a day exploring with friends Tab & Andrea in Holland, Michigan. Check them out @ourbarefoottravel.

Lots of non-rv travel coming up but until then we are living it up in Colorado and Utah!

Stay tuned for upcoming sponsored posts from Sun Outdoors in sunny Southern Utah! We are so thrilled to be showcasing two of their Moab locations, including cabin tours if they‚Äôre available while we are there. Haven‚Äôt been to Utah since 2021.

Thrilled about our Durango RV Park. We can share more details on what it‚Äôs called after we check out but for now we can tell you it‚Äôs stunning with a 2 acre off leash dog park and mountains surrounding us. They offer dog walking services too and told us they could likely workout dog sitting on a day we go out to explore! No plans yet. I usually plan on the drive but eyes were too focused on the mountains and we finished a great book: Superlife by Darin Olien. Already pre-ordered his next book coming out May 15: Fatal Conviences.

What we did in New Mexico!

Donate kids stuff at Other Mothers

Costco! So much vegan stuff. Mad about cucumbers.

Santa Fe Farmers Market & Sweetwater Harvest Kitchen recommended by @chowdernosebest (super cool account featuring a service dog for allergens)

Explora Science Center- Lennon made an awesome fully recycled fish diorama for show and tell for her Outschool class

Mango dog grooming at Pet Smart

Trevor 1706 brewery & old town Albuquerque 

New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science- NASA Mars rover scientists from current mission & telescope looking at the sun with a filter

Kaktus Brewery attached to KOA- loved the  Bernalillo KOA!

Dog sitter so we could explore without having to be only outside. Wen went to Santa Fe: Iconick Coffee Roasters for amazing coffee with house made almond milk- accidentally ordered a breakfast burrito with meat for the first time in 3 years and had a small meltdown. They were amazing and replaced it for me at no cost. I honestly thought it was vegetarian since the item below and next to were but I should have read the detailed ingredients. Grateful for the customer service. Meow Wolf amazement! Want to go to the one in Las Vegas and Denver now. Sawmill Market restaurants and shops and Ponderosa Brewing

Now you see why we are tired ü§£¬†

Don‚Äôt forget we are presenters for Full-Time Freedom Week which is an online conference happening May 8-10. Starts TOMORROW! Unleash your inner adventurer and gain the confidence to hit the road with Full-Time Freedom Week - With over 20 different online sessions, there is something for everyone!

Lia‚Äôs napping because Mother‚Äôs Day!

Fulltime-Freedom Week- Did anyone watch? Lia was really sad that it didn‚Äôt air at the proper time. But the link is now live in our linktree for anyone that wants to watch it. In all honesty, not our favorite video of us. It was recorded in July 2022 though and we didn‚Äôt have any information prior about who we would be interviewed with or what the editing would look like. What did you think?

Lia was also on a podcast: RV Queens! Which we absolutely LOVED the recording of! Again, check the link in our bio if you want to hear it and let us know what you think. You get all of the background info on boss bitch babe Lia from the 9-5 world.

Tires rotated at Discount Tire- they didn‚Äôt inflate them to the right levels so that ate 30 minutes of our day today.

Million Dollar Highway- Durango, Silverton, Ouray. Stopped at brewery and tried to go to coffee shop but it was closed. Elevation! Deer. Lia bought a coat!

We stayed at Alpen Rose RV Park and it was ASTOUNDING! We want to go back and stay an entire summer. It was right across from the narrow gauge railway.

Didn‚Äôt do railway this time either because it‚Äôs 7 hours round trip. Will go in the future when we can do 3.5 one way and 45 minutes back on bus.

Avalanche Bowls for both of us on our nights off.

Durango Farmers Market.

Didn‚Äôt make it to dispensary but will reload when we get to Oregon while our rv is being serviced.

Mesa Verde Lia & Lennon learned about ancient Pueblan people but the cliff dwelling tours opened today so they missed them.

Powerhouse Science Museum

Mother‚Äôs Day- tried to go to our favorite food truck in Moab: Rain Bowls. Got 3 other carts instead. Sushi, falafel, noodles and Lennon got a waffle.

We are at the North Moab Sun Outdoors. We will have sponsored reels coming out from here so please, please engage (like, comment) and share!!!! We are across from dog park and epic playground. The tent sites here look awesome. There is a brewery walking distance. Wish we had an e-bike right now for nights off.

Dogs will be boarding on the weekends coming up while we explore the national parks and warmer weather.

Can‚Äôt film sponsored content in Canyonlands or Arches National Parks but will make seperate reels for your enjoyment.

Did anyone see Lia‚Äôs sting Ray reel?

Next week we will be staying with Kerri. Stoked to be here two weeks and see a cousin!

Arches & Canyonlands. Haven‚Äôt been here since June 2021. Lia is going to get up and be there before 7am every day.

Lennon is going deep into drawing!

Zelda release!

Lia scheduled eye exams, dermatology, Lennon‚Äôs eye specialist and fast track swim lessons. Waiting to book gymnastics.

## 2023-09-03 

We've been in Boise for the last 3 months. It was our first time back since we hit the road 3 years ago. So we had a lot to catch up on.

- Installed 3 lithium batteries and an inverter charger, so we can actually use the 2 solar panels on our roof. We‚Äôll be testing those out this week, and using them for real in Albuquerque in October for the Balloon Fiesta
- We also had a few repairs done while the solar install was happening at Bish‚Äôs RV in Meridian. So we stayed with Lia‚Äôs parents in Portland for a couple weeks during that time.
- We emptied our storage unit! It‚Äôs actually gone! This occupied a LOT of our time this summer. Sorting through the stuff we hadn‚Äôt seen in 3 years, listing and selling a whole bunch of it, keeping a handful of things, and donating the rest. We have over $300 of credit at the kids resale shops in Idaho
- We have a few things we brought back to the trailer that we still need to organize because we ran out of time. Like our tent camping gear, and a new paddle board, and a dog stroller.
- Trevor had a work trip to California for a few days in July 
- Lia had a Keystone rally in Indiana in August for a couple weeks
- We went camping with Trevor‚Äôs family at a hot springs in Eastern Idaho
- Lennon had a really bad accident in August. She slipped while playing at a splash pad and hit the back of her head on the pavement. She had a severe, level 3 concussion and we had to go the hospital. She lost her vision, was in and out of consciousness, and vomiting a bunch. She had to have a CT scan of her brain, a spinal X-ray, bloodwork, and a bunch of other tests. Then an ambulance ride to transfer from the Nampa hospital to the Boise hospital to see a pediatric neurologist. It was‚Ä¶ AWFUL!
- It looks like is going to make a full recovery with no lasting effects. But it was a really rough week or two. With several follow up appointments, another hospital visit due to some vomiting that ended up just being a food thing.
- We also want to schedule a sleep study for Lennon because she has low oxygen saturation. But weren‚Äôt able to get it scheduled.
- Giveaway open until tomorrow 
- Posts to come from Sun Outdoors
- Upcoming stops and events!

## 2023-09-11 

- Giveaway winner @bluecrabnomads- follow them!
- Spent past week in Salt Lake City
- Trevor and Lennon went to the Curiosity Museum at Thanksgiving Point
- Lia and Lennon hiked the cave at Mt Timpanogos
- Hung out with family and rode the quadracycle. We tried to take it down the Jordan River Parkway Trail, but we got immediately swarmed by mosquitos.
- Now we are in Moab
- Staying in an Airstream for a week at Sun Outdoors Arches Gateway
- Tried to take our paddle board on Kens Lake, but there was an algae bloom warning
- Had dinner with my cousin Kerri last night
- Want to take Lennon to Fiery Furnace hike in Arches this week
- Getting coffee with John, Unicorn Arts Factory, this week
- Had some friends arrive in Moab today, so we‚Äôll be hiking Corona Arch with them this week
