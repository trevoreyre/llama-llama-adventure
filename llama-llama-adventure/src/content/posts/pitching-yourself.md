## Travel

My name is Lia from Llama Llama Adventure. We are a full-time traveling family of 3 (plus two dogs) and we cover all of our adventures and travel experiences on Instagram and our website.

I would love to feature [Showcase of Citrus] on our Instagram in exchange for complimentary admission.

Our audience of wanderers are always looking for fun ways to get out and experience the great outdoors, and I think they would love [experiencing it from the front seat of a monster truck]!

## Kids stuff

My name is Lia from Llama Llama Adventure. My husband and I travel full time with our 3-year-old daughter Lennon, and our two pups, Banana Pig and Mango Salsa (donâ€™t ask about their names ðŸ˜‚)

Would you like to collaborate on an Instagram post about [awesome kid toy]?

I love [companyâ€™s] focus on sparking creativity and exploration in toddlers. Iâ€˜m always on the lookout for the best educational products for my daughter, and I know all the families in our audience are too.

## Sustainable living

My name is Lia from Llama Llama Adventure. My husband and I travel full time in our RV with our daughter and two dogs, and we share all our tips and tricks for living in a tiny space with a small footprint, while still enjoying life to the fullest.

I would love to feature your [reusable bags] in an Instagram post about our quest to eliminate single use plastics in our life.

I really appreciate [companyâ€™s] dedication to sustainable living and the environment. Iâ€™m always on a mission to inspire our audience of 2,500 followers to be more thoughtful about the products we use, and the impact weâ€™re having on the world.

## Elements of a great pitch

1. CRAFT THE PERFECT SUBJECT LINE
Subject lines are most successful when theyre eye-catching and short.
Place your name in the subject line and keep it simple and direct.
1. INTRODUCE YOURSELF
Aim to paint a quick picture of who you are, highlighting applicable
pieces of information that align with the brand & make you a great fit.
1. HIGHLIGHT WHAT YOU LOVE ABOUT THE BRAND/PRODUCT
Include how your brand & mission aligns with theirs. What your favorite
product is or why your audience will love it.
1. CREATE AND ATTACH A MEDIA KIT
Showcase how serious you are what you can offer them.
1. SHARE LINKS TO POPULAR POSTS
Share specific examples of similar collaborations so they can see your work. By adding hyperlinks to quickly view posts or videos makes it more likely they will view it.
1. INCLUDE A CALL TO ACTOIN
Include a clear call to action to continue the conversation. Ask for the next
steps or offer to plan a call with their team.
1. DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR RATES
If you are nervous about sharing rates because a brand might shy away, you
can always share a quick note simply stating you are open to a first-time
partnership rate.
