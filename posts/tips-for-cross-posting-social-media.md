Normal posts are pretty straightforward. We edit the photo in Lightroom app on iOS. Then we usually write the text in Notes or somewhere. Post the photo on different social media apps, and copy/paste the text.

Reels are a different story. Hey, was that a pun? Every platform has different music. We usually record the reel in Instagram, and save the video without audio. If there’s a voice over, we save with the voice over audio, but not the music audio. Post to TikTok and find some replacement music that works. Facebook reels or whatever are dumb as hell. You can’t have music and voice over audio at the same time, so you have to pick one or the other.

When you tag a person or company, you need to make sure you re-tag them when you cross-post, because those tags aren’t transferred automatically.
