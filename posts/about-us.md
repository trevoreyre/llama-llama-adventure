## Tell me about you, your family, and your fur babies

Trevor is a software engineer, and Lia is a stay at home mom to our four-year-old daughter Lennon, and our two pups, Banana Pig and Mango Salsa. We enjoy hiking, finding the best breweries, discovering new ways to improve our environmental impact, and cooking with new flavors and 100% plant-based recipes.

## How long have you been RVing, and what made you choose this lifestyle?

We moved into our RV in 2019, and started traveling full time in 2020. We chose this lifestyle because we knew we wanted to travel more. We started by researching #vanlife on Instagram, but quickly realized that would be a budget breaker. And then we stumbled upon #rvlife and we were sold.

We traded in a MINI Cooper and Mazda crossover SUV for a Dodge Ram 3500, bought a Keystone Sprinter Campfire Limited (31FWMB), and moved in a week later.

## What are four adjectives or phrases you would use to describe what Camp Better means to you?

1. Be kind
1. Slow down
1. Save the earth
1. Stay wild!

## Are there any philanthropic causes you are passionate about and share with others while RVing?

Before hitting the road, we volunteered at the local Humane Society, Lia was an organizer for mental health awareness events, as well as the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

Over the last two years, we have found it difficult to find volunteer opportunities available to travelers. So we have shifted our efforts to be more conscious about where we spend our money. We support companies who make efforts toward sustainability. It is important that the products we buy are cruelty free, and limit single use plastics. And we support entrepreneurial women and minorities.

We would love to be connected to more opportunities.

## What is your favorite campsite secret or meal you like to share with others?

Our favorite thing we’ve realized is that there’s pretty much nothing we can’t cook in our RV. Our Sprinter also has a massive back window that makes it a great place to grow micro greens.

## When you started this lifestyle, what was one thing you wished you knew?

That we should have started it 10 years earlier.
